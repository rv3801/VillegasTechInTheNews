* 6/7/2022 [Google Meet for teachers can automatically transcribe lessons into a Google Doc](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/7/23156443/google-meet-educators-transcribe-lessons-docs-workspace-screencast-livestreams)

Google has intoruced some new and improved features in Google Meet aiming to make it easier for teachers to make their lessons and livestreams more accessible to students.
A transcription of lessons through Meet will be automatically created in a Google Doc, polls and Q&A functions are now available in Meet, and now Meet meetings can now be livestreamed directly to Youtube for an even larger audience.
There are even more new features outside of Google Meet, such as a new Screencast app that can allow teachers to "record, trim, transcribe, and share on-screen lessons" and giving students access to these recordings through Google Drive.
These new features and updates are part of Google's effort to improve Google Workspace for remote learning, which has grown in popularity since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Making a teacher's job easier will certainly make a positive change to the way students learn with technology, and can (in my opinion) open doors of opportunity for schools and students in the future to improve the way education is handled in the United States and all over the world.
